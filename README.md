# Hubot Spring Boot for Slack.com

This is an attempt to rewrite the popular Hubot nodeJS project in Spring Boot

Functions that would be cool:
* Hubot scripts
* Holiday notifications and list of days off
* Nom Nom time lunch train thing
* Show Github info
* Jenkins info
* Alfred/Hodor/whatever LCRM has integration
* Office map
* Mordor + Isengard type build notifications w/ registration per user or channel
* Food truck schedules for Domain
* Say the Same Thing game?
* Multiplayer speed typing game?
* Rally Integration for Scrum masters, warnings for todo times
* Hipsterpoint system clone?
* Replicron should maybe be a part of the bot?
* Outlook current available conf rooms?
* Apache OpenNLP of commands to make the bot like Siri or Google Now
* Room chat statistics (i.e. most frequent words)
* Mirror Yobot actions
